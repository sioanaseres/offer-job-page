        <div class="about-container">
          <article>
            <a href="https://www.savabros.com/">SavaBros</a> may be little known
            on the Romanian market - but we've made history in the USA.
            <br /><br />
            We started 9 years ago doing what we love: direct response
            advertising. In this short period, we've made tens of millions of
            dollars in sales. More important, we've established ourselves as a
            publishing powerhouse in markets like survival, self-reliance, or
            self-defence.
          </article>
          <article>
            We've built this company on core values related to constant growth,
            and to charting new, unfamiliar territories. <br /><br />
            We value people and the potential they have, more than the
            experience and the background they come with. Over the years we've
            worked with extremely talented people: financial experts, special
            forces “green berets”, gardening gurus, medical doctors. And we're
            aiming to become one of the best companies in the world in direct
            response marketing.
